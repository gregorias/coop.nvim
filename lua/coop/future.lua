--- A future is a synchronization mechanism that allows waiting for a task to return.
---
--- Futures turn spawned task functions back into task functions as they implement the call operator.
---
---@class Future
---@field done boolean Whether the future is done.
---@field results table The results of the coroutine in pcall/coroutine.resume + pack format.
---@field queue table The queue of callbacks to be called once the future is done.
---
---@field complete function A function that marks the future as done with the specified results and calls the callbacks
---                         in the waiting queue.
---@field error function A function that marks the future as finished with an error and calls the callbacks in the
---                      waiting queue.
---
---@field await function Waits for the future to be done.
---@field pawait async fun(Future): boolean, ... Waits for the future to be done.

---
--- - `await()`: This is a task function that yields until the future is done.
--- - `await(cb)`: This calls the callback with the results of the task function when the future is done.
--- - `await(timeout, interval)`: This function uses busy waiting to wait for the future to be done.
