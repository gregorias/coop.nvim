--- Utilities for working with coroutines.
local M = {}

--- Executes a plain coroutine function in a protected mode.
---
--- This is also a plain coroutine function.
---
--- copcall is a coroutine alternative to pcall. pcall is not suitable for coroutines, because yields canâ€™t cross a
--- pcall. copcall goes around that restriction by using coroutine.resume.
---
---@param f_co function A plain coroutine function to execute.
---@return boolean success Whether the coroutine function executed successfully.
---@return ... The results of the coroutine function.
