### Using `coroutine.resume` return format in coroutine functions

Coroutine functions such as `Future.await` first return a success boolean and
then either an error or return values.

An alternative would have been to rethrow errors, but this is not workable,
because `Future.await` is a coroutine function.
Since yields can‚Äôt cross pcalls, clients wouldn‚Äôt be able to use pcalls and
therefore catch those errors.
