    Straightforward Neovim asynchronicity with native Lua coroutines.
  </p>
</div>

Coop is a Neovim plugin that provides an asynchronous **op**eration framework
based on native Lua **co**routines.
If you write Lua code in Neovim, Coop lets you write non-blocking code that
looks synchronous like async/await in other languages.

Coop was designed to be simple by being as close to native Lua coroutines as
possible while enabling features expected from a structured concurrency
framework:

- Ability to cancel in-flight tasks or task groups.
- Ability to wait for tasks to finish and inspect results or errors.
- Ability to work with any asynchronous function whether it uses callbacks or
  `coroutine.yield`.
- Ability to launch and wait for parallelized operations, e.g., launching
  multiple asynchronous filesystem crawlers.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Neovim 0.10+

## üì¶ Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager, such as [Lazy]:

```lua
{
  "gregorias/coop.nvim",
}
```

## üöÄ Usage
